A core aim of DASH’s vision is to enable collaborative data science and to improve efficiency and reproducibility through the sharing of code. To support this, we request that code on the DASH Platform is backed up in Defra’s GitHub enterprise space. 

GitHub is a cloud-based platform that serves as a central hub for Git projects, providing a space where developers can store, share, and collaborate on their code remotely. Built on top of Git, GitHub extends the functionality of Git by offering additional tools and features for project management, issue tracking, and team collaboration. GitHub allows users to host repositories, manage requests to add to or edit the codebase, and leverage continuous integration and deployment workflows. Beyond version control, GitHub also supports Discussions, where team members can engage in threaded conversations about project ideas, challenges, and solutions. The Projects feature enables teams to organise tasks and milestones using Kanban-style boards, providing a clear overview of progress and priorities. Additionally, GitHub’s issue tracking system allows for detailed tracking of bugs, feature requests, and other project tasks, ensuring that everything is documented and addressed in an organised manner. By using GitHub, teams can securely back up their projects in the cloud, making it easier to manage and review changes, collaborate in real-time, and maintain a transparent and traceable history of their work.
